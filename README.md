# GANs-and-Style-Transfer
training a GANs architecture to generate images and Training a composed deep learning architecture using VGG16 for style transfer

In this repository, you'll find two notebooks showcasing my exploration in the field of computer vision. The first notebook focuses on training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) on a dataset of paintings. The training process begins by initializing both the generator and discriminator networks. The generator aims to generate realistic images resembling paintings, while the discriminator learns to distinguish between real paintings and those generated by the generator. Through an adversarial training process, the generator gradually improves its ability to produce convincing images, while the discriminator becomes more adept at distinguishing real from fake. After training both networks separately, they are combined into a GAN architecture. The combined model is then trained iteratively, with the generator attempting to produce images that fool the discriminator, and the discriminator striving to differentiate between real and generated images. Finally, the trained GAN architecture is utilized to generate new images that closely resemble the paintings in the dataset.

The second notebook in the repository focuses on style transfer, leveraging the popular VGG16 neural network architecture for transfer learning. The process begins by loading the pre-trained VGG16 model, which was originally trained on a large dataset for image classification. Next, the fully connected layers of the VGG16 model are removed, leaving only the convolutional base. This modified architecture serves as the backbone for the style transfer model. To train the style transfer model, a content image and a style image are selected. The objective is to generate an output image that retains the content of the content image while adopting the artistic style of the style image. This is achieved by minimizing both the content loss, which measures the difference in content between the output and content images, and the style loss, which captures the difference in artistic style between the output and style images. Through iterative optimization, the neural network learns to produce output images that successfully combine the content and style of the input images. The notebook provides detailed explanations and code implementations for each step of the style transfer process, allowing for easy exploration and experimentation with this captivating technique.
